- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **customization and extension of OpenFOAM's source code structure**
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning on the underlying libraries and classes of existing solvers, utilities & on customization of boundary conditions, new transport and thermophysical models to gain a deeper understanding of the framework
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on research projects focusing on novel applications of computational fluid dynamics, where OpenFOAM can be utilized effectively developing new solver functionalities, improving existing numerical algorithms, exploring advanced meshing techniques, optimization of parallel computing strategies within OpenFOAM, etc
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with understanding complex physics models and their implementation in OpenFOAM
